# My-Product02 - QR Code Generation and Export

## Overview

This project is designed to facilitate the easy generation of QR codes based on inputted data in Google Sheets. The QR codes are automatically created using the QuickChart API and can be exported along with the accompanying HTML and CSS code for further customization and use in web projects. The solution is ideal for No Code and Low Code environments.

## Features

- **Automatic QR Code Generation:** QR codes are created as soon as data is entered into the specified cells in the Google Sheets.
- **Customizable Outputs:** Export both the QR codes and the associated HTML and CSS for integration into your web projects.
- **Responsive Design:** The generated HTML and CSS are designed to be responsive, ensuring that the QR codes display correctly across different devices.

## Setup

### Step 1: Google Sheets Integration

1. **Open Google Sheets:**
   - Start with a new or existing Google Sheets document.

2. **Insert the Formula:**
   - In the desired cells, insert the following formula to generate the QR code automatically:
     ```excel
     =IF(ISBLANK(A3), "", IMAGE("https://quickchart.io/qr?text="&ENCODEURL(A3)))
     ```
   - Replace `A3` with the specific cell reference containing the text or URL you want to convert into a QR code.

### Step 2: Exporting HTML and CSS

1. **Export as .xlsx:**
   - Export the Google Sheets file as an `.xlsx` file after adding the QR code generation formula.

2. **Download the HTML and CSS:**
   - In the Google Sheets menu, choose to export your work in HTML and CSS formats.
   - This allows you to have a web-ready version of your QR code data.

## Usage

### Example

Here’s an example of how to use the generated QR codes:

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>QR Code Contents</th>
    <th>Description or Title</th>
    <th>QR Code</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>https://example.com</td>
    <td>Sample QR Code 1</td>
    <td><img src="https://quickchart.io/qr?text=https://example.com" alt="QR Code"></td>
  </tr>
  <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
```

### Notes

- Ensure that the URLs or text entered into the Google Sheets begin with "http://" or "https://" to generate valid QR codes.
- The QR codes can be resized by adjusting the row height in Google Sheets or by modifying the image dimensions in the exported HTML.
